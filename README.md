# Pegasus_KDM
Course Project (ME2220): Kinematic synthesis and simulation of a four-legged flying PEGASUS. It consists of a six-bar mechanism for trotting and a four-bar mechanism for the flapping of the wings. 
As part of the course Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery (ME2220), the mechanism of motion of a "Pegasus", a quadrupedal winged mythical creature, was synthesized and designed in MATLAB and its motion was simulated using Autodesk Fusion.
The problem statement required the synthesis of 2 separate mechanisms actuated by a gear train. Hence, a "Pegasus" was identified as a suitable choice because it presented the opportunity to design and actuate the mechanisms for the walking motion of the legs and the flapping motion of the wings using a single gear train.
For the legs, the "trotting" motion of a horse was taken as an inspiration and a 6-bar mechanism was modelled in MATLAB, using the Klann mechanism. This video was referred to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeYw0iH0J8w
